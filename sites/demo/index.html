**PyBlue** is a simple way to easily generate static files used to present data analysis reports.

Getting Started
---------------

*Zero configuration* - you may run **PyBlue** on any folder.

* files that end with the extension `.html` will be passed through a [Mako template][mako] rendering.
* files that start with dot `.`, or are Python `*.py` or Mako `*.mako` file will be ignored.
* files that are larger than a certain size (default 5MB) see `utils.MAX_SIZE_MB` will also be ignored in the
  site generation step. If you have large files you must set up an efficient way to synchronize them
  across locations (like `rsync`)

[mako]: http://www.makotemplates.org/

There are a few default templates in the templates folder to get you started. This demo site uses
one of the default templates [base.boot.mako](https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue/blob/master/templates/base.boot.mako).
You can place other Mako templates into the same folder that the site serves.

**Note**: Rendering this demo site will generate a few warnings and even an error on the console.
That is ok, it was done deliberately so to demonstrate how warnings and errors work.

Extensions
----------

**PyBlue** offers a number of convenience extensions to be facilitate site generation.
Importing `extensions.mako` file enables these functions.

Linking
-------

Linking to files can be achieved with the `link(pattern)` function. The pattern
is a regular expression that should match the filename.

* `link('index')` will produce ${link('index')}
* If multiple files match the first will be picked: `link('b')` will produce ${link('b')} but you will also get
  warnings in the console.
* If the pattern does not match you'll get an error message in the console and the link will also display the error:
   `link('joe')` will produce ${link('joe')}

The url component of each link is relative. The text displayed for the link comes from the `name` context variable.
When the `name` context is not explicitly set **PyBlue** will attempt to generate a readable name from the file name.

See the ${link('context')} page on how to set the `name`.

Table of Contents
------------------

You can iterate over all files in the project with `toc()` (Table of Contents). Users have
control over the order in which files are listed and the name of the links that
are displayed for each file.  The `toc()` command can filter the files by regex pattern or tags .
For example you can select files that match the word `base` with `toc(match='base')`:

${toc(match="base")}

Or you can filter by tags, to show files tagged `home` use `toc(tag='home')`

${toc(tag="home")}

The order of the entries listed with the `toc()` command is goverened by the `sortkey` context
variable that defaults to `5`.

See the ${link('context')} page on how to set the `sortkey`.

Context
-------

Any number of variables may be passed into each template. These will
be available in the template body. See the ${link('context')} page on how to add tags to files.

Galleries
---------

You can easily generate galleries from images with the `gallery()` command. For details see ${link('gallery')} page.

Advanced Usage
--------------

You can embed the source of any file with the `source(fname)` function. For example  `source("settings.py")` command
will produce:

${source("settings.py")}

As it happens this module named `settings.py` is special.
If it is present it will be automatically imported under the
attribute `p.settings` and can be accessed in every template.

For this example one can access the `p.settings.data` to produce

    ${p.settings.data}

This is a very handy way to pass common data across the site.

Note that the `source` command can also take parameters such as `start` and `end`.
When those are set only the region that between the matching regular expressions
will be included.

Capturing Output
----------------

The `execute(command)` function will insert the result of running a program into the page.
If the source of a script stored in `demo.py` is

${source("demo.py")}

then running it with `$execute('python demo.py')` will produce

${execute("python demo.py")}

Automatic Markdown
------------------

Files with the extension `.md` will automatically be rendered as Markdown.

This is the file included in the page:

${source("auto-markdown.md")}

And this is the result of viewing the file directly: ${link('auto-markdown.md')}

Testing Encoding
